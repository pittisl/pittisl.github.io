        # Mobile and Connected Health
        The COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant public health challenge, with the potential to overwhelm the healthcare system due to the high number of hospital visits. To address this issue, we are developing mobile sensing and AI techniques that allow individuals to self-evaluate possible COVID-19 infections at home using their smartphones. Our goal is to enable low-cost self-assessment and avoid unnecessary hospital visits by identifying other diseases that share similar symptoms with COVID-19, such as fever and shortness of breath. This research is urgently needed to alleviate the strain on the healthcare system and preserve medical resources for hospitalized patients, especially considering the rapid spread of the virus across the United States.
