        # Inference-time Computation in Generative AI
        Generative AI could revolutionize many current and emerging application and industry domains. However, the capabilities of today's generative models are mostly data dependent, and may fail to obey the real-world common knowledge and physical rules with out-of-distribution prompts. Our research explores inference-time methods to refine generative AI computation and unleash potentials of the current models.
