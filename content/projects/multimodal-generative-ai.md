        # Multimodal Generative AI
        Generative AI could revolutionize many current and emerging application and industry domains. In applications under real-world scenarios, rich data modalities other than text are being integrated into generative AI research to solve emerging challenges. Our research explores multimodal generative AI computation and unleash potentials of the current models.
