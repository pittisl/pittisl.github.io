        # On-device AI
        Our research strives to enable AI capabilities (inference & training) on resource-constrained embedded devices in the IoT and tailor AI models to effectively support various system applications. We utilize fine-grained and explainable knowledge about AI model execution to determine the most efficient part of the model for on-device training and inference, and employ modular neural networks and incorporates domain knowledge of specific system applications into the neural network module design.
