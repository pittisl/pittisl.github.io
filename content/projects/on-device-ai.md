        # On-device AI
        Our research aims to enable high-performance AI inference and training on resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices, to enable emerging applications such as AIoT, smart health and embodied AI. We utilize fine-grained and explainable knowledge about AI model execution to determine the most efficient part of the model for on-device training and inference, and employ modular neural networks that incorporate domain knowledge of specific system applications into the neural network module design. Our recent research focuses on enabling computational efficient inference and training of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) on weak devices, to efficiently incorporate these devices’ rich varieties of data modalities into the LLMs’ representation power and hence allow more flexible domain adaptation and model personalization.
